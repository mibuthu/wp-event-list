Manage your events and show them on your site.


== Description ==

The purpose of this plugin is to to show a list of events with date, time, description, place, etc. on your site by using a shortcode or a widget.

= Current Features =
* Admin pages to view/create/manage/modify events
* Available event data fields: event title, event date, event start time, event location, event details
* Beginning and end dates for multi-day events
* Wordpress's WYSIWYG editor for the event details. So you can include styled text, links, images and other media in your events.
* A duplicate function for events to easier create similar event copies
* Event categories
* Sync event categories with post categories
* Filter events according to dates or categories
* Include an event feed in your site

The event list can be placed in any page or post on your Wordpress site. Just include the following short code where you want the events to appear:

‘[event-list]’

You can modify the listed events and their style with attributes. All available attributes can be found on the Event List -> About page.
There is also a widget available to view the upcoming events in a sidebar with many options.

If you want to follow the development status have a look at the [git-repository on github](https://github.com/mibuthu/wp-event-list "wp-event-list git-repository").


== Installation ==

The easiest version of installing is to go to the admin page. There you can install new plugins in the menu Plugins -> Add new. Search for "Event List" and press "Install now".

If you want to install the plugin manually download the zip-file and extract the files into your wp-content/plugins folder.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get an event list to show up in a Page or Post on my site? =
Insert the shortcode [event-list] in your page or post. You can modify the output by many available shortcode attributes (see Event List -> About page for more infos).

= How do I use styled text and images in the event descriptions? =
Event List uses the built-in Wordpress WYSIWYG editor. It's exactly the same process like in creating Posts or Pages.

= Can I call the shortcode directly via php e.g. for my own template, theme or plugin? =
Yes, you can create an instance of the "SC_Event_List" class which is located in the plugin folder under "includes/sc_event-list.php" and call the function show_html($atts). With $atts you can specify all the shortcode attributes you require.
Another possibility would be to call the wordpress function "do_shortcode()".
